## What is a Database

A database is a program that either uses disk or memory to record data and query data.
Most databases are servers.

### Persistence
There is a lot of assumption that if we store data in a database that it will always be there.
- **Disk**: HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or SDD (Solid-State Drive) is referred to as non-volatile storage. The data stored here will persist even after power failure and machine crashes
- **Memory**: Short for random access memory. Data stored in memory will be lost when the process that has written that data dies
